                <img src="../Bootstrap-Portfolio/ASSET/images/Randy.png" width="200" class="Me">

                <p> I am a nerd who thinks he is cool, says my wife. I love to cycle long distances on
                    my
                    bike
                    with bike
                    clubs or a small group of friends, despite, having been hit by a car and having to
                    learn
                    how
                    to walk
                    again. My proudest moment was completing the MS 150 tour for cure. This was a
                    two-day
                    bike
                    ride that was
                    broken up into 75 miles per day. During the last 25 miles I felt like I had an
                    out-of-body
                    experience,
                    since I was so tired and fatigued that I could not feel my body anymore and made me
                    feel
                    as
                    though was I
                    was not physically there. As I said in the beginning of class, I am from New
                    Orleans,
                    Louisiana and
                    enjoy cooking all types of Cajun foods such as gumbo, red beans & rice, and shrimp
                    etouffee.
                    The city of
                    New Orleans has definitely played a part in who I am today, and I am blessed to have
                    had
                    that
                    experience.</p>
